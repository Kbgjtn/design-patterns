# State Pattern

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern achieves this by representing the different states of an object as separate classes and delegating the state-specific behavior to these classes. The object appears to change its class as its internal state changes.

## Key Components

1.  Context:
    The context is the object whose behavior varies based on its internal state.
    It maintains a reference to the current state object.

2.  State:
    The state is an interface or an abstract class that defines a common interface for all concrete states.
    It declares methods that represent the state-specific behavior.

3.  ConcreteState:
    ConcreteState classes implement the State interface.
    Each concrete state class provides a specific implementation of the state-specific behavior declared by the State interface.

Example Use Case: **Traffic Light**

Benefits of State Pattern

- Clean Separation of Concerns:
  The State pattern promotes a clean separation of concerns by encapsulating the behavior associated with each state in separate classes.

- Flexibility and Extensibility:
  It allows for easy addition of new states without modifying existing code, making the system more flexible and extensible.

- Simplifies Client Code:
  Clients interact with the context without needing to know the details of state transitions, resulting in simpler and more readable client code.

### Conclusion

The State pattern is a powerful tool for managing the behavior of an object based on its internal state. It promotes a modular and maintainable design by organizing state-specific behavior into separate classes.
