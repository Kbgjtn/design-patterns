# Template Method

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. This pattern is used to create a template or blueprint for an algorithm, providing a common structure while allowing some steps to be customized by subclasses.

## Key Components

1.  Template Method:
    The template method is a method defined in the superclass that represents the overall algorithm.
    It provides a framework for the algorithm, specifying the order and structure of the steps.
    The template method may include both abstract and concrete steps.

2.  Abstract Methods:
    Abstract methods are declared in the superclass but have no implementation.
    These methods serve as placeholders for steps that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

3.  Concrete Methods:
    Concrete methods are implemented in the superclass and represent steps with a default or common behavior.
    Subclasses can choose to override these methods to customize the behavior.


## Conclusion

The Template Method pattern is a powerful tool for creating a framework for algorithms with a common structure. It simplifies code maintenance and promotes consistency across different implementations by allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.
